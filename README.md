# Project Overview
<br/>
Carry trade strategies typically rely on interest rate differentials and currency movements. However, the complexity of forecasting exchange rate behavior—especially in the presence of the forward premium—makes carry trade returns difficult to model and vulnerable to large downside risks. This project begins by validating the continued profitability of carry trades among G10 currencies using recent historical data. It also examines the influence of negative interest rates on returns through linear regression analysis. Subsequently, the project compares traditional interest-rate-based carry portfolios with machine learning–driven alternatives across quarterly data from 1997 to 2022 for six currencies: CHF, EUR, JPY, GBP, NOK, and SEK. The benchmark strategy involves going long on the top three high-yielding currencies and short on the bottom three each quarter.
# Implementation
<br/>
ARIMA, CNN, and LSTM models were employed to build equal-weighted portfolios and benchmarked against the traditional rule-based strategy. Beyond these models, a modular framework was developed to support plug-and-play experimentation with other machine learning architectures for carry trade prediction. Unlike standard ML approaches that optimize for RMSE, this framework evaluates models based on actual portfolio performance — including mean returns, Sharpe ratio, and negative skewness — all normalized between 0 and 1. A Euclidean distance metric from the ideal point (1, 1, 1) was used to balance these objectives. The codebase is modular: abstract_ml_model.py provides a base class with train and predict methods for model extensions; model_engine.py handles training logic and portfolio construction; model_executor.py runs the full pipeline and compares results via portfolio_builder.py. The architecture is fully compartmentalized, allowing for easy integration of additional models.
# Key Findings
<br />
The analysis reaffirms that carry trades remain profitable, and that the violation of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) persists in modern data. The traditional portfolio was found to exhibit negative skewness — consistent with historical observations — while machine learning–driven portfolios, particularly those using CNNs and LSTMs, were able to both generate positive returns and reduce downside skew. Using portfolio-level metrics as model objectives, rather than prediction error, showed promise for developing more risk-aware financial strategies. The approach may be generalized to other asset classes or strategy types in future research.
